# What is Kadena?

## Why Kadena Matters
The purpose of Kadena is to be a single source for the resources needed to build blockchain applications. In doing so, Kadena solves many of the problems that have impeded widespread blockchain adoption to date including scalability, security, and ease-of-use.

#### 1. Scalability

The public blockchain is a Proof of Work protocol that has solved layer-1 scalability. This is achieved by braiding together several Bitcoin-like chains. As transaction volume increases, the network can expand to larger configurations (eg. from 10 chains to 20 chains) and deliver higher throughput capacity.

#### 2. Security

The smart contract language, Pact, is Turing Incomplete and offers Formal Verification. Turing Incompleteness reduces the language’s attack surface without compromising domain-specific functionality. Formal Verification allows smart contract authors to mathematically prove that their code does not contain bugs.

#### 3. Ease-of-use

Kadena was developed in part to be integrated into traditional business workflows and understood by non-technical users. Accordingly, Pact code is executed directly on the ledger and is stored in a human-readable format. Pact code has error messages and Pact contracts are upgradable allowing developers to fix errors or adapt logic as business needs evolve.

Kadena is among the first blockchain projects to deliver such a comprehensive feature-set.

Further, users are able to enjoy these features across Kadena’s hybrid blockchain platform, a public-private interoperable network. This hybrid solution allows users to take advantage of the  benefits from both public and private blockchains without compromise, thus enabling use cases that were previously not possible.

## Components of the Kadena Platform
Kadena is a hybrid blockchain platform consisting of a public chain protocol called Chainweb and a private chain protocol called Kuro. The public and private networks are interoperable through the smart contract language Pact.

### **1. Chainweb, Kadena’s public blockchain protocol**
HEADLINE: Chainweb is a braided, parallelized proof-of-work consensus mechanism that improves throughput and scalability while maintaining the security and integrity found in Bitcoin.
